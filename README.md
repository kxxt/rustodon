# Rustodon

This is a placeholder for a Mastodon library written in Rust.

I do want to create such a library but now I'm busy with other things. 

If you have created a high-quality rust library for mastodon and would like to use this name, please contact me via email(kxxt@kxxt.dev).

Please note there are certain requirements for the name to be transferred:

- Your library must be high-quality and well-documented.
- Your library must be published on crates.io.
- Your library must be actively maintained.
- Your library must have at least 500 stars on GitHub.
- Your library must have at least 5000 downloads on crates.io.
